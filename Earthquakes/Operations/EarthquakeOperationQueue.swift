    The delegate of an `EarthquakeOperationQueue` can respond to `EarthquakeOperation`
    lifecycle events by implementing these methods.

    In general, implementing `EarthquakeOperationQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
    want to use an `EarthquakeOperationObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
    situations where using `EarthquakeOperationQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
    For example, `GroupOperation` is the delegate of its own internal
    `EarthquakeOperationQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
