This file shows how to make an operation that efficiently waits.

/**
    `DelayOperation` is an `EarthquakeOperation` that will simply wait for a
    given time interval, or until a specific `Date`.

    It is important to note that this operation does **not** use the `sleep()`
    function, since that is inefficient and blocks the thread on which it is called.
    Instead, this operation uses `DispatchQueue.asyncAfter` to know
    when the appropriate amount of time has passed.

    If the interval is negative, or the `Date` is in the past, then this operation
    immediately finishes.
